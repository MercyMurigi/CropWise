## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant, earthy orange (#E38931) to evoke feelings of nature, growth, and harvest. This orange represents the crops being grown and is bright enough to contrast against a dark scheme.
- Background color: Dark desaturated orange (#2E241D) creates a grounding, natural feel.
- Accent color: Analogous yellow (#E3B431) to highlight calls to action and important information, with high visibility against the dark background and high differentiation from the primary color.
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text. 'Belleza' adds a touch of personality, while 'Alegreya' provides excellent readability for longer descriptions.
- Use clear, simple icons representing different crops and nutrients.
- A grid-based layout optimized for readability.
